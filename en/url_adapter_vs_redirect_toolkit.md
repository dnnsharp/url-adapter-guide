# URL Adapter vs Redirect Toolkit

### What is the difference between URL Adapter and Redirect Toolkit


Talking about redirects, DNN Sharp has two products in this area - the Redirect Toolkit and the URL Adapter. The questions that comes to our minds is, can they both be used on a site at the same time? How do you differentiate the circumstances that one or the other is more appropriate?

A suitable answer is that there is some overlap in the sense that both modules can perform redirects, but Redirect Toolkit is targeted towards conditional redirects. For example it lets you redirect users in a certain role, or based on their browser capabilities or check if a session variable exists. There's even some IP geo-location integration so you can redirect based on location. In total, there are dozens of redirect types. URL Adapter can only redirect based on what's already in the URL.
